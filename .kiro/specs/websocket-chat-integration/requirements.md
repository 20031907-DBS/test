# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements real-time WebSocket communication for the Encrptalk chat application. The focus is on establishing reliable, instant message delivery between users through WebSocket connections. The server acts as a message relay, broadcasting messages to connected clients in real-time. This foundational implementation will later support end-to-end encryption as a separate enhancement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chat user, I want to send messages that appear instantly for other participants, so that I can have real-time conversations without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL emit the message to the WebSocket server immediately
2. WHEN the server receives a message THEN the system SHALL broadcast it to all connected clients in the same chat room
3. WHEN a client receives a message THEN the system SHALL display it in the chat interface without page refresh
4. WHEN a message fails to send THEN the system SHALL show an error indicator and provide retry functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chat user, I want to establish a reliable WebSocket connection to the server, so that I can participate in real-time conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat application loads THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection to the backend server
2. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL display a connection status indicator
3. WHEN the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically up to 3 times
4. WHEN reconnection fails THEN the system SHALL show connection status and provide manual retry option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chat user, I want to join specific chat rooms, so that I can participate in organized conversations with the right people.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters the chat application THEN the system SHALL allow them to join a default chat room
2. WHEN joining a room THEN the system SHALL emit a join event to the WebSocket server with room identification
3. WHEN successfully joined THEN the system SHALL receive confirmation and load recent messages from that room
4. WHEN leaving a room THEN the system SHALL emit a leave event to stop receiving messages from that room
